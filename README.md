# Personal website for Tim Stimpson
This is is a personal website and portfolio to display my current level of expertise in software development. This website is designed to be displayed as a one page site with all content loaded initially. Javascript is used to enable navigation in the single page, and all icons were designed by myself.

## I have used the below technologies to complete this project:
* Python and Django and web server
* Custom HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Custom icons and annimation

## Future development
* Refactor the Javascript for annimations to reduce duplication of code.
* Commentary to be applied to the Javascript.
* Workflow annimations to be applied to the portfolio to provide a more detailed explanation of the projects.
* Issues with text sizing on the navigation points to be resolved.
